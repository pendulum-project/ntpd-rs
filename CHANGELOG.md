# Changelog

## [unreleased]

### Added
- Added metrics for NTS packets processed in the server
- Exposed root dispersion and root delay reported by time source as metrics.

### Fixed
- Fixed peer trying to request more cookies than it can encode in it's packet buffer.
- Fixed server not sending nts naks when receiving nts packets it can't decrypt.

## [1.0.0-rc.3] - 2023-09-20

### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect reference id being used by server.

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2023-09-14

### Changed
- The copyright from the project changed from 'Internet Security Research Group
  and Contributors' to 'Tweede Golf and Contributors'
- The `/etc/ntpd-rs/ntp.toml` file in the deb and rpm packages provided by us is
  now managed by their respective package managers. This may result in your
  config file being overwritten initially, but future upgrades should be handled
  gracefully.
- Added actual ip address of ntp server to observable data. The address field has
  been renamed for this.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2023-09-13

### Added
- Man pages have been added to the built packages.
- `ntp-ctl` now has human-friendly output

  for details. Configuration will not automatically migrate.
- The metrics for observation have been completely reworked.
- Several changes have been made to reduce the number of dependencies.
- Send software timestamping is now enabled by default.
- Hardware timestamping can now only be configured if ntpd-rs is built with the
  `hardware-timestamping` feature (off by default).
- The default observation socket path was changed to `/var/run/ntpd-rs/observe`.
- Upgraded dependencies.
- The command line interface for `ntp-ctl` and `ntp-metrics-exporter` has changed.

### Fixed
- Fix bug around handling of leap second indicators.
- Fixed bug around handling of accumulated step thresholds.

### Removed

- Sources and servers can no longer be configured via the command line.
- Logging can now only be configured via a log level, no other filtering is
  possible.
