# ntpd-rs

ntpd-rs is an implementation of NTP completely written in Rust, with a focus on exposing a minimal attack surface. The project is currently at an early stage. Both client and server functionality are stable (see release v0.2.0), although features are still limited. NTS support is under active development. If a feature you need is missing please let us know.

## Quick start

Currently, ntpd-rs only supports Linux-based operating systems. Our current testing only targets Linux kernels after version 5.0.0, older kernels may work but this is not guaranteed.

ntpd-rs is written in rust, and requires cargo 1.60.0 at a minimum to be built. We strongly recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs) to install a rust toolchain, because the version provided by system package managers tends to be out of date.

To build ntpd-rs run
```sh
cargo build --release
```
This produces a binary `ntp-daemon` in the `target/release` folder, which is the main NTP daemon.

Before running the ntpd-rs daemon, make sure that no other NTP daemons are running. E.g. when chrony is running
```sh
systemctl stop chronyd
```

The ntpd-rs daemon requires elevated permissions to change the system clock. It can be tested against a server in the [NTP pool](https://ntppool.org)
```sh
sudo ./target/release/ntp-daemon -p pool.ntp.org
```
After a few minutes you should start to see messages indicating the offset of your machine from the server. A complete description of how the daemon can be configured can be found in the [configuration documentation](CONFIGURATION.md)

## Naming

We are currently looking for a better name for this project. Suggestions for this are welcome.

## Package substructure

Currently, the code is split up into seven separate crates:
 - `ntp-proto` contains the packet parsing and the algorithms needed for clock selection, filtering and steering.
 - `ntp-daemon` contains the main NTP daemon, and deals with orchestrating the networking and configuration.
 - `ntp-ctl` contains a control interface for the NTP daemon, allowing readout of current synchronisation state and dynamic configuration changes.
 - `ntp-metrics-exporter` contains a HTTP interface for exporting the prometheus metrics.
 - `test-binaries` contains a number of simple NTP servers that can be used for testing (see below).
 - `ntp-os-clock` contains the unsafe code needed to interface with system clocks.
 - `ntp-udp` contains the unsafe code needed to deal with timestamping on the network layer.

All unsafe code is contained within the `ntp-os-clock` and `ntp-udp` packages, which are kept as small as possible. All interfaces exposed by these crates should be safe. For a more detailed description of how ntpd-rs is structured, see the [development documentation](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Test Binaries

This crate contains extremely limited NTP servers for testing purposes

* `demobilize-server` always sends the DENY kiss code, the client must demobilize this association
* `rate-limit-server` forces an increase of the poll interval to 32 seconds

## Minimum supported rust version

We try to keep ntpd-rs working on at least the latest stable, beta and nightly rust compiler. Beyond this, we keep track of the current minimum rust version needed to compile our code for purposes of documentation. However, right now we do not have a policy guaranteeing a minimum amount of time we will support a stable rust release beyond the 6 weeks during which it is the latest stable version.

Please note that the Rust project only supports the latest stable rust release. As this is the only release that will receive any security updates, we STRONGLY recommend using the latest stable rust version for compiling ntpd-rs for daily use.

## Roadmap

With the support of Prossimo we aim to build a complete NTP implementation that provides a modern alternative for ntpd and chrony. In the short term, there is one milestones on our roadmap:

**NTS support**

Plain NTP is unencrypted and does not establish a trusted connection. NTS adds these features on top of NTP. NTS is important when using NTP servers on the public internet but is not widely deployed yet. We hope that supporting it will help with adoption.

Check Prossimo's [project plan](https://www.memorysafety.org/initiative/ntp/ntp-work-plan/) for more details and for options to support their work.
