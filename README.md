# ntpd-rs

nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computer's clock, implementing the NTP and NTS protocols. It is written in Rust, with a focus on security and stability. It includes both client and server support.

If a feature you need is missing please let us know by opening an issue.

## Documentation

Be sure to check out the [documentation website] as it includes guides on getting started, installation and migration, as well as a high-level overview of the code structure.

## Usage

You can install the packages from the [releases page]. These packages configure ntpd-rs to synchronize your computers clock to servers from the [NTP pool]. After installation, check the status of the ntpd-rs daemon with

```console
$ sudo systemctl status ntpd-rs
```

If ntpd-rs was not started automatically, you can do so now with

```console
$ sudo systemctl start ntpd-rs
```

You should now be able to check the synchronization status with

```console
$ ntp-ctl status
Synchronization status:
Dispersion: 0.000299s, Delay: 0.007637s
Desired poll interval: 16s
Stratum: 4

## Roadmap

In Q1 2023 we completed our work on NTS. Our implementation is now
full-featured, it supports NTP client and server with NTS.

Our roadmap for 2023-2024:

* Q3 2023: Stable release
* Q4 2023: Experimental features, NTS pool, NTPv5
* Q4 2023 / Q1 2024: Packaging for Linux distributions
* Q1-Q4 2024: Packaging and industry adoption, maintenance & community work

We seek sponsorship for features and maintenance to continue our work. Contact
us via pendulum@tweedegolf.com if you are interested!

## History

### 2022

The project originates from ISRG's project [Prossimo], as part of their mission
to achieve memory safety for the Internet's most critical infrastructure.

<img alt="Prossimo" src="https://www.memorysafety.org/images/Prossimo%20Brand%20Assets/Prossimo%20Horizontal%20Full%20Color.svg" width="250px"/>

Prossimo funded the initial development of the NTP client and server, and NTS
support. The [NTP initiative page] on Prossimo's website tells the story.

### 2023

After completion of the initial development, the project's ownership moved from
Prossimo to Tweede golf in April 2023. See the [NTP announcement] for more
information.

Tweede golf is the long-term maintainer of ntpd-rs, that is now part of Tweede
golf's [Project Pendulum]. Pendulum is building modern, open-source
implementations of the Network Time Protocol (ntpd-rs) and the Precision Time Protocol (Statime).

In July of 2023 the [Sovereign Tech Fund] invested in Pendulum, securing ntpd-rs development and maintenance in 2023, and maintenance and adoption work in 2024.
