# ntpd-rs

Welcome to ntpd-rs, a full-featured NTP server and client implementation,
including NTS support. The documentation is divided into several sections. For
new users of ntpd-rs we recommend to start with the [getting started guide][1].
If you already have experience with other NTP software, you may want to start
with one of the specific migration guides in the *Guide* section of the
documentation.

If you are looking for a reference level explanation of functions in ntpd-rs we
recommend looking at the *Man Pages* section. Finally, if you are looking at how
ntpd-rs development is organized, please take a look at the *Development*
section of the documentation.
